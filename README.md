# PAT-01 Repository
----------------------------------

## Intro

This repository contains some of the basic sketches and data currently being used on the PAT-01 project. PAT-01 contains the current iteration of the code that will eventually be used for the final product, while the .csv files contain various tests of sensor output.

The Arduino being used for this project is a Sparkfun Pro Micro, so all of the pins correspond to this. That said, it should be easy to adapt to a different Arduino board.


## Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to create a robotic toy car that is capable of waypoint navigation and at least rudimentary object avoidance. If these objectives are achieved early, we'll just have to see what else we can do with it.
